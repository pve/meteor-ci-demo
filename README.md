# meteor-ci-demo
Small demo of a Meteor app, with tests in mocha. 

Required to get this working:
- Travis account (free)
- Heroku account (credit card required, but enough free resources)

Instructions to consolidate

For key generation in Travis, the travis cli needs to be installed

You will also need the Heroku CLI for setting it up.

Once the pipeline works, these are no longer required

This app should be live at https://pvemeteordemo.herokuapp.com/
